# Gandhikar — PRD

## Vision
A dignified, free, bilingual+multilingual AI legal companion for every Indian citizen. Empower — never threaten. Named after Mahatma Gandhi. Truth, non-violence, rights.

## Problem
Most Indians (and even many officials) don't know the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS 2023), Constitution articles, or judgment guidelines. A citizen at a police stop, an FIR desk, or a traffic check should be able to instantly know what the law says — in their own language, spoken aloud if they can't read.

## MVP (built)
- **Auth**: JWT email/password (register, login, me, language update)
- **Chat**: Streaming (SSE) multi-model Q&A with system prompt that forces exact citations (BNS section / Article / judgment)
  - Providers: Anthropic **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (default), OpenAI GPT-5.2, Google Gemini 3.1 Pro
  - Streams via `emergentintegrations` `LlmChat.stream_message()`
  - Mid-stream persistence (`finally` block) — no data loss on client disconnect
- **Voice**
  - STT: OpenAI Whisper via `/api/voice/transcribe`
  - TTS in-app: `expo-speech` (offline, native, all 22 Indian langs via device engine)
  - TTS in-cloud: OpenAI `tts-1` via `/api/voice/tts` (fallback / higher quality)
- **Languages**: 23 (English + all 22 official Indian languages via Schedule 8)
- **Know Your Rights**: 8 curated topics (police stop, arrest, FIR, women safety, traffic, RTI, consumer, DV) each with exact legal citations
- **History**: Sessions list + session detail view with TTS per message
- **Settings**: Language picker, model picker, emergency helplines (112, 181, 15100, 1098, 14433), sign out

## Architecture
- FastAPI + MongoDB (motor). Collections: `users`, `sessions`, `messages`.
- Expo Router file-based routing: `/` (splash gate) → `/login` | `/signup` | `/(tabs)/{index,rights,history,settings}` + `/session/[id]`.
- Design system: Editorial Mobile LIGHT — Khadi white surface (#FDFBF7), Ashoka Navy (#0A1C3A), Saffron accent (#C65D3B), Ashoka Green (#4B6F54).

## Market Research (Feb 2026)
- **NyayaBot** (NLU Delhi) — research prototype, English/Hindi only, not consumer-grade, focused on constitutional Q&A
- **Vaquil / Vakilsearch / LawRato** — lawyer-consulting marketplaces, paid, not empowerment-focused
- **Nyaaya.org** (Vidhi Centre) — excellent plain-language content but static website, no voice, no personal AI
- **Kaanoon.com / IndianKanoon.org** — case search databases for lawyers, not for common citizens
- **Google Legal-BERT / MOSIP** — infrastructure, not consumer apps
- **Gap**: No consumer mobile app combines (1) BNS/BNSS/BSA 2023 knowledge, (2) 22-language voice I/O, (3) exact citation with judgment references, (4) empowerment ethos. Gandhikar is uniquely positioned.

## Roadmap
- Phase 2: RAG over uploaded BNS/BNSS/BSA/Constitution PDFs for verbatim clause retrieval
- Phase 3: Paid tier — lawyer connect, document drafting (RTI, complaint letters, cease-and-desist), notarized FIR templates
- Phase 4: Emergency mode — one-tap "record rights during police stop" with automatic legal narration and NALSA alert
- Phase 5: White-label API for NGOs, panchayats, government helplines
