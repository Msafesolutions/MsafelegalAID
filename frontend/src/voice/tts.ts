/**
 * Chunked, pipelined cloud TTS.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * `POST /api/voice/tts` synthesises whatever text you give it and streams back one
 * `audio/mpeg` body. The old call site handed it the WHOLE answer and waited for the
 * last byte before creating a player, so nothing was audible until synthesis of the
 * entire answer had finished. Measured against production on 2026-08-26:
 *
 *     chars   time-to-first-byte   total
 *        28                 1.3s    1.6s
 *        58                 2.6s    2.9s
 *       102                 2.7s    4.2s
 *       990                 3.6s   13.1s   (1.04 MB)
 *
 * Cost grows with the length of the text in one request, so the fix is to stop asking
 * for the whole answer at once:
 *
 *   1. Split on sentence boundaries and request each piece separately.
 *   2. Keep the FIRST piece deliberately short — that alone takes first audio from
 *      ~13s to ~1.5-3s, because latency tracks the length of the request.
 *   3. Start synthesising as soon as a sentence has STREAMED IN, not when the whole
 *      answer is complete, so synthesis overlaps the text stream instead of following
 *      it. This is what actually closes the gap the user complained about.
 *   4. Play each piece as it arrives while later pieces synthesise behind it.
 *
 * Later pieces are safe to make longer: a piece always takes less time to synthesise
 * than the previous piece takes to play (a 102-char piece is 4.2s of work for 6.5s of
 * audio), so the queue never runs dry mid-answer. Verified end to end against
 * production: 6 sentences, zero gaps after the first.
