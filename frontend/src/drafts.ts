Sub: Refund of security deposit of ₹${val(v, 'deposit', '______')} for the premises ${val(v, 'premises')}

Sir / Madam,

1. I was your tenant in the premises ${val(v, 'premises')} at a monthly rent of ₹${val(v, 'rent', '______')} and had paid you a security deposit of ₹${val(v, 'deposit', '______')}.

2. I handed over vacant and peaceful possession of the premises to you on ${val(v, 'vacate_date', '__________')} along with the keys. The premises were handed over in the same condition, subject to normal wear and tear.

3. My dues towards rent and utilities as on the date of handover are: ${val(v, 'dues', 'NIL')}.

4. Under the tenancy agreement and the state tenancy law applicable to these premises, the security deposit is refundable on handover of vacant possession after deducting only lawful dues. Despite my repeated requests, the deposit has not been refunded to me.

5. I therefore call upon you to refund ₹${val(v, 'deposit', '______')}, less only the dues stated in paragraph 3, WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS of receipt of this notice, by bank transfer or cheque in my name.

6. If the amount is not refunded within the said period, I shall be constrained to approach the Rent Authority / Rent Controller and the appropriate civil forum for recovery of the deposit with interest and costs, entirely at your risk and cost.

Yours faithfully,

Sub: Non-payment of wages of ₹${val(v, 'amount', '______')} for ${val(v, 'period')}

Sir / Madam,

1. I joined your establishment on ${val(v, 'joining_date', '__________')} as ${val(v, 'designation')} at a monthly wage of ₹${val(v, 'monthly_wage', '______')}. Employment status: ${val(v, 'exit_status')}.

2. My wages for ${val(v, 'period')}, amounting in total to ₹${val(v, 'amount', '______')}, have not been paid to me despite repeated oral requests.

3. Under Section 17 of the Code on Wages, 2019, wages of a monthly-paid employee must be paid before the expiry of the seventh day of the succeeding month, and where the employment has ended by removal, dismissal, retrenchment or resignation, all wages payable must be paid within two working days.

4. I therefore call upon you to pay the said sum of ₹${val(v, 'amount', '______')} to me, along with all other amounts lawfully due (including any statutory bonus, gratuity and leave encashment), WITHIN SEVEN DAYS of receipt of this notice.

5. If payment is not made within the said period, I shall file a claim before the authority appointed under Section 45 of the Code on Wages, 2019, and a grievance on the SAMADHAN portal of the Ministry of Labour & Employment, seeking the amount due together with compensation, which the authority may award up to ten times the amount found due, entirely at your risk and cost.
