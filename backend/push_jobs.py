"""
Scheduled push jobs — runs once every 24h inside the backend process (same
pattern as corpus_migration's startup background task; no external
scheduler/cron dependency needed at this user scale).

Two jobs, both best-effort (a failure in one never blocks the other, and
neither ever raises into the caller):

1. Daily re-engagement nudge — free-tier users who have not sent a single
   query yet today get a reminder they still have free questions available.
2. Dead-law bookmark sweep — re-checks every saved answer's cited sections
   against the corpus's CURRENT is_dead_law status. If a section a user
   bookmarked has since been struck down / flagged dead, they get notified
   once (the bookmark's stored citation is updated in place so the same
   flip is never re-notified).
