DHARA CORPUS — IPC (1860) and CrPC (1973) legacy statutes.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023 replaced the Indian Penal Code 1860 and
the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) 2023 replaced the Code of Criminal
Procedure 1973, both with effect from 1 July 2024.

BUT the old codes are STILL live law for:
  * every offence committed BEFORE 1 July 2024, and
  * every FIR, trial and appeal already pending on that date.

Millions of such matters are running in Indian courts right now, so a citizen
asking "what is IPC 498A?" or "what is CrPC 438?" must get a real answer.

Each entry carries a `bns_mapping` note inside `scope_note` telling the user the
equivalent new-code section, so the answer is useful for both old and new cases.

Format is identical to CORPUS in corpus.py (same required keys). This module is
imported and appended to CORPUS at import time.
